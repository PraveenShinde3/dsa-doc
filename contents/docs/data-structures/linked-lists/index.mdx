## Linked Lists: An Introduction

A **linked list** is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element, called a **node**, points to the next node in the sequence. This structure makes linked lists a powerful and flexible alternative to arrays, especially when frequent insertions and deletions are needed.

## The Structure of a Node

At its core, a linked list is a collection of nodes. Each node typically contains two parts:

- **Data**: The value stored in the node.
- **Next**: A pointer or reference to the next node in the list. The final node's `next` pointer is usually `null` to mark the end.

The first node in a linked list is called the **head**, and it serves as the entry point for traversing the list.

## Types of Linked Lists

- **Singly Linked List**

  - This is the most basic form, where each node has a pointer to the next one, allowing traversal in only one direction.

- **Doubly Linked List**

  - In a **doubly linked list**, each node has an additional pointer, `prev`, which points to the previous node. This allows for bidirectional traversal, but it uses more memory per node.

- **Circular Linked List**
  - A **circular linked list** is one where the last node's `next` pointer points back to the head of the list, creating a loop. This can be either singly or doubly linked.

## Why Use Linked Lists?

### Advantages

- **Dynamic Size**: Linked lists can easily grow or shrink, as memory is allocated dynamically.
- **Efficient Insertions and Deletions**: Adding or removing a node is fast (O(1)) if you have a reference to the node's predecessor. You simply update a few pointers.

### Disadvantages

- **No Random Access**: To get to the nth node, you must traverse the list from the head, which takes O(n) time.
- **Extra Memory Overhead**: Each node requires additional memory to store the pointer to the next node.
