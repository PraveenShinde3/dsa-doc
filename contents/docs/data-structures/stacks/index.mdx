## Introduction to Stacks

A **stack** is a fundamental linear data structure that follows a particular order for operations. The order is **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)**. Think of it like a stack of plates: you can only add a new plate to the top, and you can only take a plate from the top. The last plate you put on is the first one you take off.

This "last-in, first-out" principle makes stacks incredibly useful for managing tasks and data in a specific sequence.

## Core Operations

A stack is defined by a few primary operations that allow you to interact with it. All these operations happen at the "top" of the stack.

### 1. Push

The **push** operation adds a new element to the top of the stack.

```javascript
stack.push("A"); // Adds 'A'
stack.push("B"); // Adds 'B' on top of 'A'
```

### 2. Pop

The pop operation removes the topmost element from the stack and returns it. Trying to pop from an empty stack results in an error known as a "stack underflow."

```javascript
stack.pop(); // Removes and returns 'B'
stack.pop(); // Removes and returns 'A'
```

### 3. Peek

The peek operation returns the topmost element without removing it from the stack.

```javascript
stack.peek(); // Returns 'A'
```

### 4. Is Empty

The isEmpty operation checks if the stack is empty.

```javascript
stack.isEmpty(); // Returns true
```

### 5. Size

The size operation returns the number of elements in the stack.

```javascript
stack.size(); // Returns 0
```

## How Stacks are Implemented

Stacks can be implemented using various underlying data structures. The two most common ways are using arrays and linked lists.

### Using an Array (or List)

This is the simplest implementation. An array can be used to store the stack elements, and a variable (often called top) can keep track of the index of the last inserted element.

- Pros: Easy to implement and memory-efficient (no pointers).

- Cons: Can have a fixed size, leading to a "stack overflow" if you push too many elements. Dynamic arrays can solve this but may have performance costs for resizing.

JavaScript

```javascript
// A simple array-based stack implementation in JavaScript
class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.items = [];
  }

  push(element) {
    this.items.push(element);
  }

  pop() {
    if (this.isEmpty()) {
      return "Underflow";
    }
    return this.items.pop();
  }

  peek() {
    return this.items[this.items.length - 1];
  }

  isEmpty() {
    return this.items.length === 0;
  }
}
```

### Using a Linked List

In this approach, each element is a node that contains data and a pointer to the next node. The top of the stack is the head of the linked list.

- Pros: The stack can grow dynamically, so there's no fixed size limit (besides available memory).

- Cons: Requires slightly more memory due to the storage of pointers in each node.

### Complexity Analysis

The efficiency of stack operations is one of its greatest advantages.

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Push      | O(1)            | O(n)             |
| Pop       | O(1)            | O(n)             |
| Peek      | O(1)            | O(n)             |
| isEmpty   | O(1)            | O(n)             |

### Real-World Applications

You interact with the stack data structure every day without realizing it!
