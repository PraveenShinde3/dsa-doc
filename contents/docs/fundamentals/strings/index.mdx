## Introduction to Strings

A string is a fundamental linear data structure that represents a sequence of characters. Unlike primitive data types such as integers or floats, strings handle textual information and can contain letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, and special characters. Strings are essentially character arrays with additional properties and built-in functionality that make text processing more convenient and powerful.

In most programming languages, strings are enclosed in double quotes (e.g., "Hello World"), though some languages also support single quotes.

## String Representation and Memory Layout

### Internal Structure

Strings are typically implemented as contiguous memory blocks containing character data. The exact representation varies by programming language and implementation:

### Character Array Representation:

- Each character occupies one memory position

- Characters are indexed starting from 0

- Sequential storage enables efficient access

  For accessing any character in a string:
  <b>str[i] = Base Address + (i Ã— sizeof(char))</b>
</Callout>

## Time Complexity

| Operation            | Time Complexity | Explanation                                                          |
| -------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Access by index      | O(1)            | Direct access using index is constant time.                          |
| Concatenation        | O(n + m)        | Combining two strings of lengths n and m requires copying both.      |
| Substring extraction | O(k)            | Extracting a substring of length k requires copying k characters.    |
| Search for substring | O(n \* m)       | Naive search checks each position, leading to O(n\*m) in worst case. |
| Comparison           | O(n)            | Comparing two strings of length n requires checking each character.  |
| Insertion            | O(n)            | Inserting a character requires shifting elements, so linear time.    |
| Deletion             | O(n)            | Deleting a character requires shifting elements, so linear time.     |

## Benefits of Strings

- Strings are easy to use and understand, making them a fundamental data type in programming.
- They provide a way to represent and manipulate text data effectively.
- Strings support various built-in functions and methods for common operations like searching, slicing, and formatting.
- They can be concatenated, split, and transformed using a variety of algorithms.
- Strings are immutable in many languages, which can lead to safer and more predictable code.

## Limitations of Strings

- Strings can be memory-intensive, especially when dealing with large texts or frequent modifications.
- Insertion and deletion operations are costly **`(O(n))`** due to the need to shift characters
- Strings are immutable in many languages, meaning any modification creates a new string, which can lead to performance overhead.
- Handling multi-byte characters (like Unicode) can complicate string manipulation and indexing.
- Strings can lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly, such as buffer overflows or injection attacks.

## How to Implement Strings in Different Languages

| Language | Mutability | Example Declaration        |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| C        | Mutable    | `char str[] = "hello";`    |
| C++      | Mutable    | `std::string s = "hello";` |
| Java     | Immutable  | `String s = "hello";`      |
| Python   | Immutable  | `s = "hello"`              |
| JS       | Immutable  | `let s = "hello";`         |
