## Important Mathematical Concepts

### 1. Number Theory

Understanding properties like:

- Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM)
- Prime numbers and prime factorization
- Modular arithmetic (useful in hashing and cryptography)

### 2. Combinatorics

- Counting principles, permutations, and combinations
- Useful in problems involving arrangements and probability

### 3. Recurrence Relations & Series

- Handling recursive algorithms by solving recurrence relations
- Summation of series such as arithmetic and geometric progressions

### 4. Probability and Statistics

- Analyzing randomized algorithms
- Understanding expected values, conditional probability, independence

### 5. Graph Theory Basics

- Representing relationships with nodes and edges
- Concepts like connectivity, path, cycles, and graph traversal.
