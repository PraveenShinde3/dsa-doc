Understanding the mathematical foundations is crucial for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This section covers key concepts that will help you analyze and design efficient algorithms.

## Why Mathematics Matters in DSA

- To analyze the **time and space complexity** of algorithms
- To understand problem constraints and optimize solutions
- To use mathematical reasoning for algorithm design and proofs

## Complexity Theory

Understanding Big O, Big Θ, and Big Ω notations to describe algorithm efficiency.

**Big-O Notation (O-notation):**

- Describes the upper bound of algorithm performance

- Represents worst-case time complexity

**Big-Omega Notation (Ω-notation):**

- Describes the lower bound of algorithm performance

- Represents best-case time complexity

**Big-Theta Notation (Θ-notation):**

- Describes tight bounds when upper and lower bounds are the same

- Represents average-case complexity

## Important Mathematical Concepts
