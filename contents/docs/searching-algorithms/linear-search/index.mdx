## What is Linear Search?

Linear search is the simplest searching algorithm. Imagine you're looking for your friend in a line of people - you start from the first person and check each one until you find your friend. That's exactly how linear search works!

It checks each element in a list one by one, from start to end, until it finds what you're looking for or reaches the end of the list.

## How Does It Work?

Here's the simple process:

1. Start at the first element
2. Check if it matches what you're searching for
3. If it matches, you're done! Return the position
4. If it doesn't match, move to the next element
5. Repeat until you find it or reach the end

## Real-Life Example

Let's say you have a list of exam scores: `[65, 80, 55, 90, 75]`

You want to find if score `90` exists in the list.

**Step by step:**

- Check position 0: Is 65 equal to 90? No, move forward
- Check position 1: Is 80 equal to 90? No, move forward
- Check position 2: Is 55 equal to 90? No, move forward
- Check position 3: Is 90 equal to 90? Yes! Found it at index 3

## Time and Space Complexity

**Time Complexity:**

- **Best Case:** O(1) - The element is at the first position
- **Average Case:** O(n) - The element is somewhere in the middle
- **Worst Case:** O(n) - The element is at the last position or not present

**Space Complexity:** O(1) - We only use a single variable for iteration

## When to Use Linear Search?

**Use Linear Search when:**

- Your list is small (under 100 elements)
- The list is unsorted
- You only need to search once or rarely
- Simplicity is more important than speed

**Don't use Linear Search when:**

- Your list is very large (thousands of elements)
- The list is sorted (use Binary Search instead)
- You need to search many times (consider sorting first)

## Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**

- Very simple to understand and implement
- Works on unsorted lists
- Works on any type of data
- No preprocessing needed

**Disadvantages:**

- Slow for large datasets
- Inefficient compared to other algorithms for sorted data
- Every search takes potentially O(n) time

## Summary

Linear search is your first step into the world of searching algorithms. While it's not the fastest, it's the most straightforward and works in all situations. Master it well, because understanding linear search will help you appreciate why other, more complex algorithms exist!

**Key Takeaway:** Linear search checks every element one by one until it finds what it's looking for. Simple, reliable, but can be slow for large datasets.
