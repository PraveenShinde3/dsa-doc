## What is Recursion?

Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem.

It is typically used when:

- The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems.
- Each decision reduces the input size until a base case is reached.

### How to Identify Recursion?

A problem is recursive if:

- We need to make `decisions` based on `choices`.
- Each choice leads to a smaller input or simpler version of the problem.
- There is a `clear base case` (a stopping condition) where recursion ends.
- The subproblems can be combined to form the `final solution`.

<Callout>ðŸ‘‰ Choices + Decisions = Recursion</Callout>

## Example: Subsequence / Substring Generation

Consider the string: `const s = "abc";`

Recursion is about making binary choices at each step: `include` or `exclude` each character from the original string. Exploring all such decision paths results in all possible subsequences.

**Recursive Decision**

For each character in the string, we recursively decide to:

- `Include` the character.
- `Exclude` the character.

Generating All Subsequences: Recursive Tree Approach

| Output | a   | b   | c   |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- |
| ""     | âœ—   | âœ—   | âœ—   |
| a      | âœ“   | âœ—   | âœ—   |
| b      | âœ—   | âœ“   | âœ—   |
| c      | âœ—   | âœ—   | âœ“   |
| ab     | âœ“   | âœ“   | âœ—   |
| bc     | âœ—   | âœ“   | âœ“   |
| ac     | âœ“   | âœ—   | âœ“   |
| abc    | âœ“   | âœ“   | âœ“   |

âœ” = character included  
âœ— = character excluded
